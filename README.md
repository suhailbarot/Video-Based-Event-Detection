# How To Run:

1. Run the script run.pipeline.sh for feature extraction and final prediction
2. Average Precision is printed on the command line.
3. Models are currently set at best parameters, comment and uncomment to change the model.
4. Directory structure is same as was given to us with the starter code, my scripts assume that the data is in the same location.
